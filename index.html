                <p class="line10">She calls out to the man on the street</p>
                <p class="line10">"Sir, can you help me?</p>
                <p class="line10">It's cold and I've nowhere to sleep</p>
                <p class="line10">Is there somewhere you can tell me?"</p>
                <p class="line40">He walks on, doesn't look back</p>
                <p class="line40">He pretends he can't hear her</p>
                <p class="line40">Starts to whistle as he crosses the street</p>
                <p class="line40">Seems embarrassed to be there</p>
                <p class="line60">Oh, think twice, 'cause it's another day for you and me in paradise</p>
                <p class="line60">Oh, think twice, 'cause it's another day for you</p>
                <p class="line70">You and me in paradise</p>
                <p class="line10">Think about it</p>
                <p class="line10">She calls out to the man on the street</p>
                <p class="line50">He can see she's been crying</p>
                <p class="line100">She's got blisters on the soles of her feet</p>
                <p class="line100">She can't walk but she's trying</p>
                <p class="line60">Oh, think twice, 'cause it's another day for you and me in paradise</p>
                <p class="line60">Oh, think twice, it's just another day for you</p>
                <p class="line70">You and me in paradise</p>
                <p class="line60">Just think about it</p>
                <p class="line20">Oh Lord, is there nothing more anybody can do?</p>
                <p class="line20">Oh Lord, there must be something you can say</p>
                <p class="line10">You can tell from the lines on her face</p>
                <p class="line10">You can see that she's been there</p>
                <p class="line50">Probably been moved on from every place</p>
                <p class="line50">Cause she didn't fit in there</p>
                <p class="line60">Oh, think twice, 'cause it's another day for you and me in paradise</p>
                <p class="line60">Oh, think twice, it's just another day for you</p>
                <p class="line70">You and me in paradise</p>

                <p class="line10">Mhm</p>
                <p class="line10">Think about it</p>
                <p class="line70">It's just another day for you and me in paradise</p>
                <p class="line70">It's just another day for you and me in paradise (para-paradise)</p>
                <p class="line70">Paradise</p>
